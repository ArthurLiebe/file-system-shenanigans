# file-system-shenanigans

Read and Write
Time for some file system shenanigans! In this exercise, you will create two functions to handle file operations in a Node.js environment. The goal is to get hands-on experience with the fs (File System) module and learn how to manage files and directories dynamically.

Goal
You will create two functions:

createFileWithMessage: This function creates a file with a given message as content.
deleteFileByName: This function deletes a file by its name.
Requirements
createFileWithMessage
Purpose: Creates a file with a message as content. If the file already exists, it should append the message to the file.
Execution: Should be callable via the terminal and as a function in the code, i.e:
1
node createFileWithMessage "Hello there"
and

1
createFileWithMessage("Hello there")
Directory Structure:
The function should check the current date and ensure a directory for the day exists.
Directory names should follow the format yyyy-mm-dd.
If the directory doesn’t exist, create it.
If the directory exists, create the file inside it.
File Naming: File names should follow the format hh:mm:ss.txt.
Behavior: If the file doesn’t exist, create it. If the file exists, append the message to it.
deleteFileByName
Purpose: Deletes a file by its path and name.
Execution: Should be callable via the terminal and as a function in the code.
Behavior: If file doesn’t exist, inform de user. If file exists, delete it and confirm.
Instructions
Part 1: createFileWithMessage
Setup:
Import the required modules: fs and path.
Function Definition:
Define a function createFileWithMessage(message) if you are using promises, it has to be async!
Date and Time:
Get the current date and time.
Format the directory name as yyyy-mm-dd.
Format the file name as hh:mm:ss.txt.
Directory Check:
Check if the directory for the current date exists.
If it doesn’t exist, create the directory.
File Creation/Appending:
Construct the full path for the file.
Create the file with the message
Terminal Execution:
Allow the function to be called via the terminal with a message passed as an argument.
Part 2: deleteFileByName
Setup:
Import the required modules: fs and path.
Function Definition:
Define a function deleteFileByName(filePath).
File Deletion:
Check if the file exists.
If it exists, delete the file.
If it doesn’t exist, log an appropriate message.
Terminal Execution:
Allow the function to be called via the terminal with the file name passed as an argument.
Hints
Check Node.js official docs
From the fs module:
access : Check user’s permissions to access a path or file, effectively checking if the path or file exist 😀
writeFile : Well…
mkdir : Creates a directory
unlink : Removes symbolic links (shortcuts) or files
From the path module:
join: Joins segments in a path. Basically concatenation but properly done for file systems paths. e.g. join('/mydir/, '/myfile.txt') will remove unnecessary / symbols
For command line execution, remember you can use process.argv to access the arguments:
e.g. for the following command:

1
node index.mjs create "Hello there"
you could access the command and message like:

1
2
const command = process.argv[2];
const argument = process.argv[3];
